Instructions for running the code in Jupyter Notebook
Step 1: Install Jupyter
You need to install Jupyter by using pip (Python's package manager). Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

pip install jupyter

Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook
After installing Jupyter, you can start it by running the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

jupyter notebook


This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

Step 3: Create a New Notebook
Once Jupyter Notebook is running, you will see the Jupyter dashboard in your web browser. On the right side, you'll find a "New" button. Click on the "New" button, and a drop-down menu will appear.

Step 4: Select Python Notebook
In the drop-down menu, click on "Python 3" under the "Notebook" section. This will create a new Jupyter Notebook with the Python kernel.

Step 5: Name your Notebook
The new notebook will open in a new tab, and you can see the name "Untitled" at the top. To give your notebook a meaningful name, click on the "Untitled" text and enter the desired name.

Step 6:
Load Data and Install Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary dataset file ("titanic.csv") and install the required libraries if you haven't already. 
You can install the required libraries using !pip install library_name in a code cell.
Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries in a code cell using import statements.

Step 7:
Load the Data: Load the dataset ("titanic.csv") and (bank.csv) using the pd.read_csv() function and assign it to the variable credit_data.

Step 8:
Run the Code: To execute each code block, click on the cell and press "Shift + Enter" or click the "Run" button in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
Observe Output: Observe the output of each code block, including visualizations and model evaluation metrics, in the notebook cells below the executed code.

Step 9: Save your Notebook
Remember to save your work regularly by clicking on the "Save" button (disk icon) or using the "Ctrl + S" shortcut. This will save your notebook as a .ipynb file in the current working directory.

Step 10: Close the Notebook
To close a Jupyter Notebook, you can either click on the "Close and Halt" option in the File menu or simply close the browser tab.
